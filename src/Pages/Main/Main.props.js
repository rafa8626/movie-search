            overview: `David, a robotic boy—the first of his kind programmed to love—is adopted as a 
            test case by a Cybertronics employee and his wife. Though he gradually becomes their child, 
            a series of unexpected circumstances make this life impossible for David. Without final 
            acceptance by humans or machines, David embarks on a journey to discover where he truly belongs, 
            uncovering a world in which the line between robot and machine is both vast and profoundly thin.`,
